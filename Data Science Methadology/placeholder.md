# Data Science Methodology Final Assignment

## Chosen Topic:
I have chosen **Hospitals** as the topic for this task. Hospitals provide a rich environment for the application of data science, and I am particularly interested in how data science can improve patient outcomes through predictive models.

## Business Understanding Stage:

### Problem Description:
As a hospital manager, one of the main issues I face is reducing patient readmission rates. Patients who are readmitted shortly after discharge can indicate that the initial treatment or discharge process was not optimal, which increases operational costs and impacts the hospital's reputation. I want to create a system that helps identify high-risk patients who are likely to be readmitted.

### Question:
**"Can we predict if a patient will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days based on their medical records and treatment history?"**

## Data Science Methodology Stages:

### 1. Analytic Approach:
The problem at hand is a **binary classification** problem. The goal is to predict whether a patient will be readmitted within 30 days (Yes/No). To achieve this, we will develop a classification model using techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests.

### 2. Data Requirements:
The data required to answer the question should include:
- Patient demographics (age, gender, etc.)
- Medical history (diagnoses, procedures, previous admissions)
- Treatment data (medications, length of stay, treatments received)
- Discharge information (instructions given, follow-up care)
- Outcome data (whether the patient was readmitted, time to readmission)

### 3. Data Collection:
The hospitalâ€™s electronic medical record (EMR) system would be the primary source for data collection. Data will be gathered from previous patient admissions, medical records, discharge summaries, and follow-up visits. Data related to readmissions should be clearly labeled.

### 4. Data Understanding and Preparation:
In this stage, the data will be explored using descriptive statistics to understand its distribution, identify missing values, and discover relationships between variables. Key tasks include:
- Removing irrelevant columns (e.g., patient IDs)
- Handling missing data through imputation or removal
- Normalizing or scaling variables (like age, length of stay)
- Encoding categorical variables (e.g., diagnosis codes, gender)

### 5. Modeling and Evaluation:
Once the data is cleaned and prepared, various classification models will be tested, including logistic regression, random forests, and support vector machines. The models will be evaluated using cross-validation and performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score to ensure that the model is effective in predicting patient readmissions. Hyperparameter tuning may also be applied to improve model performance.

By following these stages, we will be able to answer the business problem and help the hospital identify high-risk patients, potentially reducing readmission rates and improving patient care.
